## üìö Educational Content

### Social Skills Tips
```
Tip 1: Active Listening
"Good listening isn't just about hearing words. It's about showing the other person you care about what they're saying. Try nodding, making eye contact, and asking questions!"

Tip 2: Reading the Room
"Every social situation has its own 'mood' or energy. A library is quiet and calm, a party is loud and fun, a doctor's office is serious and calm. Try to match the energy of the place you're in."

Tip 3: Conversation Starters
"Starting conversations can feel scary, but remember: most people like talking about themselves! Ask about their interests, their day, or give them a genuine compliment."

Tip 4: Handling Awkward Moments
"Awkward moments happen to everyone! If you say something that doesn't land right, a simple 'Sorry, that came out wrong' or 'Let me try that again' usually works well."
```

### Emotional Intelligence
```
Understanding Emotions:
"Emotions are like weather - they come and go. It's normal to feel different emotions throughout the day. The key is learning to recognize them and respond in helpful ways."

Emotional Vocabulary:
Basic: Happy, Sad, Angry, Scared, Excited, Tired
Intermediate: Frustrated, Proud, Disappointed, Grateful, Nervous, Content
Advanced: Overwhelmed, Empathetic, Conflicted, Fulfilled, Apprehensive, Serene

Empathy Building:
"Empathy means understanding how someone else feels. It's like trying on their shoes - you're not walking in them, but you can imagine how they might feel."
